2. CharityCampaign

"A charity campaign is being held in a pastry shop to raise funds in which pastry chefs from all over the country can participate. Initially, we read from the console the number of days the campaign will run and the number of pastry chefs who will participate. Then on separate lines we receive the number of cakes, eclairs and croissants that will be prepared by one pastry chef per day. The following price list should be taken into account:

· Cake - 45 BGN

· Eclair - 5.80 BGN

· Croissant - 3.20 BGN

1/8 of the final amount will be used to cover the expenses for the products during the campaign. Write a program that calculates the amount collected at the end of the campaign.

Input

Five lines are read from the console:

The number of days the campaign runs - an integer in the range [0 … 365]

The number of pastry chefs - an integer in the range [0 … 1000]

The number of cakes - an integer in the range [0… 2000]

The number of eclairs - an integer in the range [0… 2000]
